export const BackgroundBiomorphMOCK: BackgroundProps = {
  _id: new Realm.BSON.ObjectID(),
  Name: 'Biomorph',
  Description: `When the old empires fell, so did their laws limiting 'genetic enhancement'. A few scientists seized this opportunity to engage in radical experimentation. This involved both the genetic manipulation of naturally born individuals and the creation of wholly new 'tank-born' individuals. In either case, those that survived these experiments often had unique abilities to control their own bodies, such as realigning their skeletal structure, growing new limbs, changing their skin tones, or even growing additional organs to deal with toxic substances or alien environments. Unfortunately, many biomorphs were also left psychically scarred by their modifications. While the worst of these tend to destroy themselves quickly, almost all carry some form of phobia, psychosis, or other mental impairment. Depending on the abilities of a biomorph, they tend to dress in loose, or very stretchy outfits, or have specialized suits of armour made that take into account their abilities. More than any other background, biomorphs tend to form independent crews because they are on the run - either from those that created them or want to do further experiments on them, or to escape the consequences of some crime (often unintended)`,

export const BackgroundCyborgMOCK: BackgroundProps = {
  _id: new Realm.BSON.ObjectID(),
  Name: 'Cyborg',
  Description: `A fusion of man and machine, cyborgs have been a constant, if rare, feature of every war for the past several centuries. Specialist cyborgs have been created to ful- fil nearly every military role including infiltration, stealth, reconnaissance, or just 
  straight-up combat. Despite their obvious advantages, cyborgs are rarely cost effective and thus were never produced in great numbers. With the end of the Last War, many cyborgs attempted to 'retire', but most found 
  that it requires huge sums of money to keep their bodies working. For that reason, many have gone into business for themselves, working as mercenaries, bounty 
  hunters, private investigators, or retrieval specialists. 
  Cyborgs vary greatly in appearance. Some are indistinguishable from humans, 
  some look like humans with obvious robotic parts, and a few look completely ro- 
  botic and only feature a human brain or nervous system.`,
